# üöÄ Clustering Weather Stations in Sri Lanka üåç

I‚Äôm excited to share my recent **data science project** where I applied **machine learning techniques** to cluster **18 weather stations** across **Sri Lanka** based on their **climatic data**. Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:

## 1. Data Preprocessing
I started by merging two datasets‚Äîone containing **monthly climatic data** (rainfall, Tmax, Tmin) and another with **station geography** (latitude, longitude, altitude). After ensuring **data quality** by removing duplicates and handling missing values, I **standardized** the data to ensure all features contributed equally.

## 2. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
To reduce the complexity of the data and avoid **multicollinearity**, I used **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. This helped me capture **90% of the variance** in just a few components, simplifying the dataset without losing critical information.

## 3. Clustering Analysis
I applied **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** techniques to group the stations. The **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** helped identify **4 optimal clusters**. The **dendrogram** visually showed how stations are merged into clusters, revealing distinct climatic zones.

## 4. Visualization
I used visualizations like **PCA variance plots**, **correlation heatmaps**, and **cluster visualizations** to better understand the data. These plots provided insights into the distribution of the features and the relationships between them.

## 5. Insights & Conclusion
The **clustering** revealed distinct climatic zones in Sri Lanka, which can aid in **regional planning**, **climate-related decisions**, and **agriculture**. This project not only strengthened my skills in **unsupervised learning** but also showed the power of **data science** in understanding climatic patterns.

I'm excited to share these findings and would love to discuss further!
